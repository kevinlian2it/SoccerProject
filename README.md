## Project Description
The Soccer Talent Identifier project leverages machine learning to match soccer players with teams where they are most likely to excel. Motivated by the growing complexity and competitive nature of sports analytics, as well as a huge personal passion for the sport, this project seeks to solve the challenge of identifying optimal player-team fits using data-driven insights. By analyzing detailed player statistics from fbref, we aim to develop predictive models that can recommend player signings based on a team's strategic needs and playing style.

Although most high-level soccer teams already have detailed databases for player scouting, these databases are highly confidential. This project seeks to make player scouting and knowledge more accessible to everyday fans and make fans more informed about players and clubs. The main goals for the semester include successfully scraping and processing player data from fbref, developing and testing machine learning models for player-team matching, and creating a user-friendly interface for accessing these insights.

The project holds significant utility and interest for soccer clubs, scouts, and analytics enthusiasts, offering a novel tool for data-informed decision-making in player acquisition and team development. By harnessing the power of machine learning, the Soccer Talent Identifier promises to bring a new level of precision to the art of building winning teams.

## Requirements, Features and User Stories

**Feature 1: Data Scraping**

User Story: As a data scientist, I need to automatically extract player statistics and historical performance data from fbref.com, so I can analyze and utilize up-to-date data without manual intervention.

Scenario: The system schedules daily scraping tasks that pull the latest player statistics from fbref.com, ensuring that the dataset is always current and reflects the most recent games.

**Feature 2: Data Preprocessing**

User Story: As a developer, I need tools to clean and preprocess the raw data, transforming it into a structured format, ready for analysis and model training.

Scenario: Once data is scraped, it undergoes preprocessing to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and convert text data into numerical values that can be used in machine learning models.

**Feature 3: Player Performance Prediction Model**

User Story: As a team strategist, I want to use historical data to predict future performance of players, so I can make informed decisions about potential signings.

Scenario: A team strategist inputs desired player characteristics, and the system provides predictions and insights on how well players matching these characteristics are expected to perform in the upcoming season.

**Feature 4: Player-Team Fit Analysis**

User Story: As a soccer club scout, I need a tool that can suggest players who fit our team’s style and needs, optimizing our recruitment strategy.

Scenario: The scout specifies the team’s playing style and needs using the system interface. The system then analyzes available players and suggests those whose past performance and skills best match the criteria.

**Feature 5: Interactive Dashboard**

User Story: As a coach, I need an interactive dashboard to visualize player statistics and model outputs, helping me to easily understand data-driven insights.

Scenario: The coach logs into the dashboard to view a visual representation of data on player performance trends, predictions, and recommended signings, with options to drill down into specific aspects like defensive skills or goal scoring.

- **Commits**: For having up to date code, commits and push requests will be done constantly in order to ensure the latest work is represented in the repository.

### Testing and Evaluation

Testing is a critical component of the development lifecycle to ensure functionality, performance, and reliability:

- **Manual Testing**: Manual testing will be conducted to verify the user interface and the system as a whole. This approach is particularly useful for exploratory testing, usability testing, and to ensure that the project meets the user requirements.

By employing this development and testing methodology, the project aims to achieve a high standard of code quality and maintainability, ensuring that the final product is reliable.

## Potential Challenges and Roadblocks

### Challenge 1: Data Scraping Robustness
**Anticipated Issue**: The structure of FBref.com may change, which could break the scraping logic.

**Strategies**: To mitigate this, I could:
- Write scraping functions with BeautifulSoup that target class names or IDs that are less likely to change.
- Set up monitoring scripts that alert us if the output data format changes unexpectedly.

### Challenge 2: Data Quality and Preprocessing
**Anticipated Issue**: Ensuring the quality of data after scraping and during preprocessing.

**Strategies**: 
- Implement thorough validation checks post-scraping.
- Use Pandas to handle missing or inconsistent data effectively, possibly with custom cleaning functions.

### Challenge 3: Model Accuracy and Performance
**Anticipated Issue**: Creating a machine learning model with satisfactory accuracy and performance.

**Strategies**:
- Begin with simple models using Scikit-learn to establish a baseline before moving to more complex algorithms.
- Experiment with different feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.

### Challenge 4: Automated Testing
**Anticipated Issue**: Developing a comprehensive suite of automated tests.

**Strategies**:
- Utilize pytest for unit testing from the outset.

## Conclusion and Future Work
